## **Introduction**  
Slydr is a blockchain-powered platform designed to empower creatorsâ€”artists, musicians, designersâ€”and their fans. By enabling fans to purchase and resell rights to exclusive content, Slydr creates a sustainable ecosystem where creators earn passive income and fans turn their passion into profit.  

Built on **Solana**, Slydr leverages fast, low-cost transactions and smart contracts to ensure transparency, security, and fairness.

## **How It Works**  
1. **Creators Upload Content**:  
   - Creators upload their work (e.g., art, music) and set resale terms.  
   - Content is minted as an NFT to ensure authenticity.  

2. **Fans Purchase Rights**:  
   - Fans buy resale rights to the content.  
   - They can resell the content or rent usage rights.  

3. **Royalties Are Distributed**:  
   - Every resale triggers automatic royalty distribution.  
   - Creators and fans earn their share of the profits.
